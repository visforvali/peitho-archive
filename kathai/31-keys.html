      <h3 class="pb-5"><i><span lang="ta"><i>Koppai</i></span> (cup)</h3>			   <p class="epigraph" style="text-align: right;">Content note: animal death </p>	   
                  <p class="pt-3">A king had trained a hawk for hunting and would take the hawk with him when he went out. Once he and his huntsmen were riding through a valley in a rocky desert. The king grew thirsty but saw a rock with water dripping over its edge. He dismounted and held out his goblet to collect some water, while his hawk flew up and circled overhead. When the cup was full, the king raised it to his lips eagerly; but the hawk swooped down and knocked the cup out of his hand, spilling the water, before alighting on the top of the rock from which the water was trickling down. He picked up the cup and collected the water once more. Again, when he brought the cup to his lips, his hawk dived down as before and knocked it from his hand. Furious, the king drew his sword and shouted, "Do not prevent me again, or you will pay dearly." So saying, he patiently collected the water for a third time and held his sword as he raised the cup. His hawk indeed swooped down and knocked the cup out of his hands, and so the king struck off its head with a quick sweep of his sword. However, the cup had fallen into a crevice where he could not retrieve it. The king climbed the rock to drink from the souce, but when he reached the top, he saw that the pool contained a dead common krait, whose venom had leached into the water. Immediately, the king forgot his thirst, thinking only of his hasty action that cost his loyal hawk its life. In his hastiness, he had killed his protector (Sivananda, 1998, pp. 26-27).</p>
                  <p>Pain is rhetorical. Develop discriminative power. Study the unfamiliar communication signals of others, on and off the page, to avoid executing your allies due to your hastily imposed projections.</p>
